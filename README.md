## Installation

This installation guide will assume that you already have an install of MongoDB on your computer. If you don't you can find installation instructions for that [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

After you have an install of MongoDB on your computer follow the steps below to install the Social Meeds Api:

1. Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/Tutor78/social-meeds).
2. Navigate to the root directory.
3. Using the command line run ```npm install``` to install the dependancies.
4. Run npm start to begin the server (listens on Port 3001 by default).

## Usage

Social Meeds is a backend that contains the skeleton of information for a social network. It does not contain a frontend and requires an API testing software such as Postman or Insomnia to function. A demo video can be found [here](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/q6MJ71uXWTCAtnzIhuZM).
